# Python-Tutorial
I compile Python stuff around the internet for personal use, and summarize it here.<br>
Expect many commented lines and non-formatted code lines; as some parts have not been needed at the moment;<br>
I grab the code, store it for when I would one day need it. If looks formatted, and similar in style to other files, it's likely edited.<br>
<br>
Feel free to enquire of any part you have a trouble with.<br>
